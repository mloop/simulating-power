# A colleague comes to you...

> # I have a cohort study where we have collected data at two time points. We would like to collect data at a third time point. Our key question of interest is whether changes in risk factors for CVD predict changes in subclinical markers of the disease, such as measures of atherosclerosis from imaging data?

---

> # Also, we want each participant to have a random intercept, random slope over time, and allow for non-linearity in the trajectory.

* ## This collaborator was doing great work, had gotten multiple R01s and was very well-regarded in the community. It was important that this go well.
* ## It was my first time with a power calculation this complicated.
* ## So I fired up my sample size program to look for something...

    * ## AUC, competing risks (wrote my own code)
