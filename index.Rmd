"I have a cohort study where we have collected data at two time points. We would like to collect data at a third time point. Our key question of interest is whether changes in risk factors for CVD predict changes in subclinical markers of the disease, such as measures of atherosclerosis from imaging data."

--

"Also, we want each participant to have a random intercept, random slope over time, and allow for non-linearity in the trajectory."

* ## This collaborator was doing great work, had gotten multiple R01s and was very well-regarded in the community. It was important that this go well.
* ## It was my first time with a power calculation this complicated.
* ## So I fired up my sample size program to look for something...

# Problems when planning a study

* The investigators want to answer their question
* You want to do a good job
* Bioethical considerations of participants

# Using fake data simulation

1. Simulate fake data
2. Fit different models
3. Calculate a performance metric and compare across methods

class: center, middle, inverse

# Simulate fake data

---
# Components

1. likelihood
2. estimand (likely $\mu$ or $g(\mu)$)
3. covariates
4. covariate effects
5. sample size
---

# What might you vary?

--

* Sample size
* (Joint) distribution of covariates
* Measurement error in covariates
* Shape of covariate effects
* Drop-out rate
* Treatment non-response rate
* True likelihood
* Recruitment/enrollment mechanism

---

# Methods of simulation

* I use `R`, particularly the `purrr` package, which allows you to generate and evaluate data in clean and elegant way
* If you want to try another method, you simply create a new column of model fits with the different method
* We will explore this in the exercise
* I like specifying a distribution for effects instead of varying them, since it keeps down the number of simulation conditions and respects the fact that I don't know what it will be

---
# Recommendations for simulation setup

1. You can modify a "parameter" by changing one line of code
2. You can add a parameter by adding two(-ish) lines of code
3. You retain what the parameters were for each iteration (especially if random)
4. The output is a dataset

# Fit different models

---

# What do I mean by "different models?"

--

* Linear vs. non-linear function of covariates
* Continuous vs. categorical predictors
* Missing data mechanism
* Method of variable selection (stepwise vs. lasso)
* Prediction methods vs. inference
* Multilevel vs. single level (fixed vs. mixed)

# Calculate a performance metric and compare across methods

---

# What are some performance metrics?

--

* Power
* Type 1 error
* Confidence interval width
* Probability the sign is wrong
* Probability you select exactly the correct model
* Distance from the truth (aka, 'How wrong do you want to be?')
* Probability you over estimate the effect by a factor of 2
* How often does algorithm fail?

---
# Possible summaries

* Proportions and means
* Scatterplots (confidence interval width vs. sample size)
* Histograms of point estimates using different methods

# Use fake data simulation to plan studies!

## Advantages

.pull-left[
* Correct power calculations for any model you can write down
* Compare statistical methods you are considering
* Your assumptions are crystal clear (you generated the data!)
* Identify issues with proposed data analysis (sometimes it's not obvious a model isn't identifiable)
* Provide example manuscript figures
]
.pull-right[
* Sanity check about assumed covariate distributions and effects
* Evaluate performance on a fairly well-defined, finite data set (our knowledge of method performance is often based on aymptotics)
* You can show the investigator how badly things can go
* Your final descriptions can incorporate the level of uncertainty you have in model parameters
]

---

# Caveats

* I'm not certain about how much of this is effective in grant applications
* If the investigators change their minds a lot, you waste a lot of time
* Investigators often concentrate more on what looks better and what they can "sell", rather than the whole picture
